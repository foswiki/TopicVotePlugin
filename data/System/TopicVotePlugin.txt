---++ Description

The plugin allows you to setup a voting system for topics. Imagine you have an idea, 
innovation or suggestion described in a topic and wants wiki users to vote for it, 
TopicVotePlugin let you setup and manage a voting system. You can even include multiple 
topics in your voting system or in this case in your poll.
   
There is a configuration topic for each voting system to define users and to set a number 
of credit points for them. All these users can now participate in that voting and 
share their credit points out on sevaral topics belonging to your poll.

---++ Usage

---+++ Setup new voting system

To setup a new voting system simply add =%<nop>TOPICVOTESETUP%= to a topic. 
It will automatically inserts the necessary table for configuration: 

| *Header* | *Description* | 
| username | name of wikiuser who participate |
| credit points | number of remaining credit points to share out |
| latest vote | datetime of users last vote |
| comment | use it for any comment about that user | 

Each table row defines a wikiuser and a number of credit points. 
Add as many wikiusers as you want to join your voting.

Additionally another table will be inserted which is used for logging
all submitted votes. Do not touch this table!

| *Column:* | *Description:* |
| date | date of that log entry |
| username | name of wikiuser who has voted |
| topic | name of topic which has been voted |
| credit points | number of shared credit points on that topic |

__Note:__ Do not touch this table! It is updating automatically. Any editing manually
will mix up the voting stats.

---+++ Include topic
To include a topic into a voting system simply add =%<nop>TOPICVOTE{...}%= to a topic. 

Supported parameters:

| *Parameter:* | *Description:* | *Default:* |
| =topic=""= | The topic which contains the necessary voting system | Current topic |
| =disable=""= | Set disable="1" to disable voting for the current topic | 0 |

| *Row:* | *Description:* |
| topic score | Total of all shared credit points on the current topic |
